# Assignment 1.1 — Written Requirements

## Question 1 — Nullability decisions

| Field | Decision | Domain justification |
|---|---|---|
| `title` | Non-nullable | A listing without a title isn't a job posting it renders as an incomplete data item that shouldn't exist as a `Job` object at all. |
| `company` | Non-nullable | Every listing is created by a company as part of that company's onboarding and a job without a company is a ghost Job. |
| `location` | Non-nullable | Jobseekers filter and browse by location as a primary decision factor, even remote roles have a defined location value ("Remote"), so the field should always present. |
| `salary` | Nullable | An employer may choose not to disclose salary because some Job posts allow salaries to be negotiated with the candidate and some even show "Market Realated" which I will implement in this Assignment. |
| `closingDate` | Nullable | Some employers list roles as open-ended with no fixed application deadline. |
| `description` | Non-nullable | A listing without any description gives a jobseeker nothing to evaluate; CareerHub requires at least a minimal description to post a Job. |
| `employmentType` | Non-nullable | Employment type (full-time, part-time, contract) is a core filter jobseekers rely on, and every listing is categorized at creation. |
| `isOpen` | Non-nullable | A job's open/closed state is a must to always be available because closed Jobs sometimes have to be filtered out for the candidate. |

**Most dangerous nullable field:** `salary` is the most dangerous field to
render without an explicit null check. If forgotten, a jobseeker would see
a literal `"null"` string where a salary figure should be displayed ("Salary:
null")  which reads as a rendering bug, undermines trust in the platform,
and could even be misread as the job paying nothing, discouraging a
qualified applicant from applying for the Job.

## Question 2 — The salary type decision

**Chosen type: `double?`**

- The CareerHub API will return salary as a numeric type because
backend systems that model money as raw numeric values keep sorting,
filtering, and range-based queries (e.g. "jobs paying over R30,000")
trivial at the database level and formatting as a display string is a
presentation concern that belongs in the frontend, not the data layer.
- Storing salary as a pre-formatted string in the backend would make numeric
operations like sorting-by-salary or salary-range filters require string
parsing on every request, which is fragile compared to querying a numeric
column directly.

- On screen, the user never sees the raw `double` instead they see the output of
`displaySalary`, which formats the raw number into a currency string (e.g.
"R35 000 per month"). When salary is confidential, the model stores
`salary = null`, and `displaySalary` returns `"Market-related"` rather
than the widget needing to check for null itself, keeping that business
logic in exactly one place.

## Question 3 — Status representation

**Chosen approach: `bool isOpen`**

**Limitation:** A `bool` can only represent two states, but a real
CareerHub listing has four possible states (Active, Closed, Draft,
Expired). Using `isOpen` forces every non-active state — Draft and
Expired — to collapse into `false`, indistinguishable from a job the
employer deliberately closed. The UI currently can't tell a jobseeker
*why* a job isn't open, and an employer can't distinguish an unpublished
draft from an expired listing.

- **Week 2 fix:** Dart's **enum** would model this more safely because it
can represent all four mutually exclusive states explicitly
(`enum JobStatus { active, closed, draft, expired }`), making it a
compile-time error to handle only two of the four states.

## Question 4 — Named constructor justification

1. **`Job.closed(...)`** — CareerHub employers regularly close listings
   once a position is filled, and marking a job closed should be an
   explicit, readable action in code (`Job.closed(...)`) rather than
   remembering to manually pass `isOpen: false` alongside every other
   field.
2. **`Job.remote(...)`** — Remote roles are common enough on CareerHub
   that pre-filling `location: 'Remote'` via a named constructor prevents
   inconsistent location strings ("remote", "Remote", "Work from home")
   that would otherwise fragment location-based filtering across
   listings created by different employers.

## Scratch output (Part 2 verification)

Output from `scratch/job_demo.dart`, run via `dart run scratch/job_demo.dart`:

```
Job(title: Senior Frontend Software Engineer, company: TechCorp Cape Town, location: Cape Town, isOpen: true, salary: 37500.0, closingDate: 2026-07-24 00:00:00.000)
  canApply: true
  displaySalary: R37500 per month
---
Job(title: UX/Web Designer, company: DesignHouse Sandton, location: Sandton, isOpen: true, salary: confidential, closingDate: none)
  canApply: true
  displaySalary: Market-related
---
Job(title: Data Analyst Intern, company: DataWorks Pretoria, location: Pretoria/Hybrid, isOpen: false, salary: 18500.0, closingDate: 2026-06-19 00:00:00.000)
  canApply: false
  displaySalary: R18500 per month
---
Job(title: Part-Time Content Writer/Promoter, company: MediaCo, location: Remote, isOpen: true, salary: 15000.0, closingDate: 2026-07-24 00:00:00.000)
  canApply: true
  displaySalary: R15000 per month
---
```

This confirms `canApply` is `false` only for the closed job, `displaySalary`
falls back to `"Market-related"` for the job with no salary, and
`toString()` produces readable, identifiable output for all four states.

## Colour choice

- I chose a deep teal seed colour (`#0D3B36`) because it conveys
professionalism and trust qualities central to a platform where users
make career and hiring decisions while remaining visually distinct from
the blue used by most competing job platforms.

---

## Part 3 verification (JobCard)

Manually confirmed on both Web and Android emulator:

- ✅ Job with no salary shows **"Market-related"** — not "null", not a blank line
- ✅ Job with no closing date shows **no closing date row at all** — not "null", not "Closes: "
- ✅ Closed job's card visually communicates status via a red "Closed" chip
- ✅ Remote job's location renders correctly as **"Remote"**
- ✅ Toggling a job from open to closed in the hardcoded list and hot
  reloading updates the card's chip without restarting the app

---

## Part 4 verification (App shell)

- ✅ Four job variants present, covering fully populated / no-salary /
  closed / remote edge cases
- ✅ App title is **"CareerHub"**, not "Flutter Demo"
- ✅ Material 3 seed colour set via `ColorScheme.fromSeed()` (deep teal,
  justified above)
- ✅ Hot reload confirmed updating a card when a job's status changes

## Getting Started (Clone & Run)

**This setup works for low-end PCs — Chrome/Web is the recommended target
for quick iteration, with Android emulator instructions included for those
who want to test on a virtual device.**

### Step 1: Install prerequisites

1. Install **Git**
2. Install **VS Code**
3. Open VS Code → Extensions → search and install **Flutter** (Dart comes
   bundled with it)
4. Install **Android Studio** once, just for the Android SDK — if you're on
   a low-spec machine, you don't need to open it again; VS Code handles
   everything else
5. Accept Android licenses:
   ```
   flutter doctor --android-licenses
   ```
   Press `y` to accept all.

### Step 2: Clone this repository

```
git clone <repository-url>
cd careerhub
```

### Step 3: Get dependencies

```
flutter pub get
```

### Step 4: Verify your setup

```
flutter doctor
```

Ignore any Android Studio/emulator-specific warnings if you only plan to
run on Web.

### Step 5: Choose a device and run

**Option A — Web (recommended for low-end machines):**

1. `Ctrl+Shift+P` → **Flutter: Select Device** → choose **Chrome** or **Edge**
2. Open `lib/main.dart`
3. Press **F5**, or click the debug button top-right

**Option B — Android emulator (for those who want a mobile-accurate test):**

1. Open **Android Studio → Device Manager** and create/start a virtual
   device (Pixel 7/8 recommended; API 34–35 for stability)
2. Once the emulator is running, `Ctrl+Shift+P` → **Flutter: Select Device**
   → choose the running emulator
3. Open `lib/main.dart`, press **F5**

Either way, the app launches showing the CareerHub job listings.

### Step 6: Hot reload

While the app is running, edit anything in `lib/main.dart` or the widgets
(e.g. toggle a job's `isOpen` value), save (`Ctrl+S`) — the running app
updates instantly without a full restart.

## Already installed but outdated version?

Check your current version:
```
flutter --version
```

Update:
```
flutter upgrade
```

Re-run `flutter doctor` afterward to confirm.

---

## Before committing to version control

1. Clean build artifacts and dependencies:
   ```
   flutter clean
   ```
2. Confirm `.gitignore` includes:
   ```
   .dart_tool/
   .flutter-plugin-dependencies
   build/
   .packages
   ```
3. Commit:
   ```
   git add .
   git commit -m "your message"
   ```
4. Restore dependencies after cloning/cleaning:
   ```
   flutter pub get
   ```

## Troubleshooting

| Error | Solution |
|---|---|
| `flutter` not recognized | Restart terminal/VS Code (PATH changes need a fresh shell) |
| Android Studio warning | Ignore if only using Web |
| License error | Run `flutter doctor --android-licenses` again |
| Stuck on upgrade | Run `flutter upgrade --force` |
| Web app not showing as device | Confirm Chrome/Edge is installed, restart VS Code |
| Emulator "System UI isn't responding" | Usually low host RAM — close other heavy apps (Android Studio, Docker) while the emulator runs |
| Emulator stuck/failing to boot | Try Cold Boot instead of Quick Boot in AVD settings; consider a lower API level (34/35) over the newest preview image |
