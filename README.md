# CareerHub Mobile

CareerHub is a job listing and application platform.

## Getting Started (Clone & Run)

**This setup works for low-end PCs — Chrome/Web is the recommended target
for quick iteration, with Android emulator instructions included for those
who want to test on a virtual device.**

### Step 1: Install prerequisites

1. Install **Git**
2. Install **VS Code**
3. Open VS Code → Extensions → search and install **Flutter** (Dart comes
   bundled with it)
4. Install **Android Studio** once, just for the Android SDK — if you're on
   a low-spec machine, you don't need to open it again; VS Code handles
   everything else
5. Accept Android licenses:
   ```
   flutter doctor --android-licenses
   ```
   Press `y` to accept all.

### Step 2: Clone this repository

```
git clone <repository-url>
cd careerhub
```

### Step 3: Get dependencies

```
flutter pub get
```

### Step 4: Verify your setup

```
flutter doctor
```

Ignore any Android Studio/emulator-specific warnings if you only plan to
run on Web.

### Step 5: Choose a device and run

**Option A — Web (recommended for low-end machines):**

1. `Ctrl+Shift+P` → **Flutter: Select Device** → choose **Chrome** or **Edge**
2. Open `lib/main.dart`
3. Press **F5**, or click the debug button top-right

**Option B — Android emulator (for those who want a mobile-accurate test):**

1. Open **Android Studio → Device Manager** and create/start a virtual
   device (Pixel 7/8 recommended; API 34–35 for stability)
2. Once the emulator is running, `Ctrl+Shift+P` → **Flutter: Select Device**
   → choose the running emulator
3. Open `lib/main.dart`, press **F5**

Either way, the app launches showing the CareerHub job listings.

### Step 6: Hot reload

While the app is running, edit anything in `lib/main.dart` or the widgets
(e.g. toggle a job's `isOpen` value), save (`Ctrl+S`) — the running app
updates instantly without a full restart.

## Already installed but outdated version?

Check your current version:
```
flutter --version
```

Update:
```
flutter upgrade
```

Re-run `flutter doctor` afterward to confirm.

## Before committing to version control

1. Clean build artifacts and dependencies:
   ```
   flutter clean
   ```
2. Confirm `.gitignore` includes:
   ```
   .dart_tool/
   .flutter-plugin-dependencies
   build/
   .packages
   ```
3. Commit:
   ```
   git add .
   git commit -m "your message"
   ```
4. Restore dependencies after cloning/cleaning:
   ```
   flutter pub get
   ```

## Troubleshooting

| Error | Solution |
|---|---|
| `flutter` not recognized | Restart terminal/VS Code (PATH changes need a fresh shell) |
| Android Studio warning | Ignore if only using Web |
| License error | Run `flutter doctor --android-licenses` again |
| Stuck on upgrade | Run `flutter upgrade --force` |
| Web app not showing as device | Confirm Chrome/Edge is installed, restart VS Code |
| Emulator "System UI isn't responding" | Usually low host RAM — close other heavy apps (Android Studio, Docker) while the emulator runs |
| Emulator stuck/failing to boot | Try Cold Boot instead of Quick Boot in AVD settings; consider a lower API level (34/35) over the newest preview image |
